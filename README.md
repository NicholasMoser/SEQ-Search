# SEQ Search

Search SEQ files in a directory for a specific hex sequence. Used when you have the
bytes of an SEQ file but don't know which SEQ file you're looking at.

## How to Use

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/NicholasMoser/SEQ-Search/releases),
extract it, and run the executable. Enter the byte sequence in hex and type in the
directory you wish to search.
